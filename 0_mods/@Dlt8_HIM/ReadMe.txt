Helicopter Improvement Mod
by [MSK]Delta8

Hi everyone,
this mod enables you to use the open/close-door actions of some BIS helicopters from ArmA III.
You are also able to shoot from some passenger-positions (FFV; firing-from-vehicle) of these helicopters (2 "Doorgunner"s at each door of Kajman and Ghosthawk and an additional "Loadmaster" in Mohawk).

Supported helicopters are:
- Ghosthawk
- Kajman
- Mohawk

Features WIP/planned:

[- M900 (Doors only)] --> see "comments"
[- Huron (Doors only)] --> see "comments"
[- Taru (Doors of each variant)] --> see "comments"

Issues known:
- If you go into aiming-mode on a FFV-position in Kajman you will only see the mid-part of the rotor in front of you...this happend with update 1.40. Thx BIS!
- FFV possible although doors are closed. I'll try to solve this later.
- You can shoot through parts of the vehicles (floor, walls) from FFV-positions. I tried to manage an acceptable shooting-angle-to-bug-ratio.

Comments of the author:
Currently I've got no idea how to implement the M900-, Huron- and Taru-doors feature, because of BIS ".ebo" (encrypted pbo), but I'll give it a try! As a temporary solution I suggest you to use parts of my HeliDoor Script (http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=27385).
Please report any bugs, I'll work on some solutions. If there are any acceptable...
